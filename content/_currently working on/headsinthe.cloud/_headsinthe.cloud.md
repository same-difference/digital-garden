## What is headsinthe.cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è ?
Heads in the Cloud is a playful, interactive space for exploring your own beliefs and seeing how others think.

You're presented with intriguing philosophical dilemmas ‚Äî everything from _"Should you pull the lever?"_ to _"What does freedom really mean?"_ You type out your honest thoughts, and behind the scenes, AI helps match your ideas to famous schools of thought from across history.

But that's just the beginning.

Your answers become part of a living universe.
Each school of thought is a star.
Your answers orbit them as planets.
Unusual or mixed ideas become comets drifting between the stars.

As you answer more, your personal galaxy takes shape ‚Äî showing where your ideas align, conflict, or don't fit neatly anywhere at all.

You can also explore what others have written, zoom through deep philosophical spaces, and even export your journey to see how your thinking evolves over time.

This is not a test, or a debate.
It‚Äôs a quiet invitation to wonder, to reflect, and to discover how messy, beautiful, and varied human thought can be.

## Development
I just graduated and this is a solo project as I apply to jobs. I've got a bunch of documentation already to help me out, which is available for you to explore here!

### Project Planning
- [[milestones]]: to see the full detailed breakdown of all 7 phases
- [[ideas for expansion]]: to see features I might add in a major update to the site
### Technical Details
- [[tech stack]]: to see the technologies I plan to use
- [[data pipeline]]: to see how I plan to process the data in the backend
- [[state management]]: to see how I plan to store local data
### Experience
