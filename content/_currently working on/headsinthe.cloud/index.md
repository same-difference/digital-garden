Heads in the Cloud is a living universe of ideas.
Answer philosophical dilemmas, discover where your thoughts align with centuries of thinkers, and explore how others see the world. Your answers orbit stars of thought, drift as comets, or become new worlds of their own. No right or wrong â€” just curiosity, reflection, and endless possibilities.

See the [[_headsinthe.cloud|primary project doc]] for more detail.
