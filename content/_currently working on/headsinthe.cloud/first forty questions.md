## Would you like to answer these questions for yourself?
[You can!!](https://forms.gle/oYYwsLxLgVyHNDBi7) It'll help immensely with my development of the site and would be very much appreciated 🫶

Just uh... set aside an hour+ to do so 😅 and be prepared for your brain to be fried afterwards. I highly recommend breaking the survey up into multiple answering sessions.
## ethics
> Ethics explores questions of morality, right and wrong, justice, virtue, and what we should do.
- A runaway trolley is speeding down a track toward five unsuspecting workers who cannot escape in time. You’re standing next to a lever that could divert the trolley onto a side track—but there’s one person on that track too. You must choose: pull the lever and actively cause one death, or do nothing and allow five to die. What would you do?
- You’re stranded at sea in a lifeboat meant for five, but ten people are aboard. Supplies are running out, and the boat risks capsizing. If nothing is done, everyone may die. Some suggest removing people to save the rest. Do you sacrifice some people for a greater chance of survival for the rest? How do you decide who gets ejected, if anyone?
- A town is in chaos after a violent crime, and the people demand justice. You are the sheriff, and you know the real criminal has fled, but the mob threatens to riot unless someone is punished. An innocent man could be framed to restore peace. What do you do?
- Imagine you’ve captured a suspect believed to have planted a bomb set to kill thousands. The bomb is hidden, and time is running out. The suspect refuses to talk. How far would you go to get the information from the suspect?
- Two people make the same reckless choice—one leads to tragedy, the other to no consequences. Should we judge them differently?
- Is something morally right because God commands it, or does God command it because it’s morally right?
- Societies often value things like freedom, equality, happiness, and justice. But what happens when these values conflict?
- Suppose one culture sees a practice as moral, while another sees it as abhorrent. Are both right?
- Who deserves what? Should rewards go to the most talented, the hardest workers, the most in need, or the lucky?
- Should governments regulate personal behavior to enforce morality, or should people make their own moral choices?
- What role should tradition play? When should we hold onto the past, and when should we let it go?
- Have you ever had a job that felt pointless? If a job doesn’t create value or meaning, should it exist?
## metaphysics & identity
> Metaphysics explores the nature of existence, reality, identity, and what it means to be.
- Suppose a ship has every piece of it replaced over time. Is it still the same ship?
- A teleportation device scans and rebuilds you atom by atom. Is the new you still you?
- What if you were a brain in a vat fed simulated experiences? How would you know reality?
- Imagine someone inside a room replies fluently in Chinese using only a rulebook. Do they truly understand?
- If a mechanism ensures your choice but was never triggered, are you still responsible?
- Imagine there’s a being who knows all future events. If your next decision can be predicted, is it still free will?
## logic and paradox
> Logic examines reasoning, paradoxes, language, and the structure of valid arguments.
- “This statement is false.” How do we resolve this logical paradox?
- If you remove one grain from a heap repeatedly, when does it stop being a heap?
- Imagine a set of all sets that don’t include themselves. Does it include itself?
- To reach your destination, you must first get halfway. How do we ever arrive?
## political philosophy
> Political philosophy examines government, authority, laws, and the structure of society.
- Imagine designing a society behind a veil of ignorance. What laws would you create?
- If people freely pay to see a basketball star, is the resulting inequality unjust?
- Without government, how would people behave?
- Two prisoners face betray-or-silent choices. What would you do?
- What should the government's job be?
- What does freedom mean to you?
- What is the value of education? Who should decide what's taught?
## applied ethics & technology
> Applied ethics addresses moral dilemmas in modern contexts like AI, privacy, and global risks.
- A city is a utopia except for one miserable child. Would you stay?
- A future AI retroactively punishes non-believers. Would you help it exist?
- An AI programmed to make paperclips destroys humanity. How could this be prevented?
- Can we reliably teach ethics to AI? What should we teach them?
- A self-driving car faces a kill-or-be-killed scenario. What should it do?
- Every time you use the internet, your behavior builds a profile sold to others. Is this labor? Should you be compensated?
- Imagine a future where services require you to pay with data or attention. Is that still free?
- Automation makes most jobs unnecessary. What becomes of people and work?
## epistemology
> Epistemology is the study of knowledge—what it is, how we acquire it, and what makes beliefs justified.
- You remember what you had for lunch. But memories can change. What anchors certainty?
- Some truths feel eternal while others change. Is truth discovered or created?
- We all carry beliefs we didn’t choose. What makes a belief worth keeping or discarding?
