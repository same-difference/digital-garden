I started looking for affordable hosting for my [[wordpress blog]] and started with AWS Lightsail, then Hetzner, and then realized I was getting really into the [[server hardening]] side of things and wanted to host more apps, like my [[rail royale]] game and my [[discord to obsidian bot]]. Cloudflare workers wouldn't work for the discord->obsidian bot and running a serverless go project is a lot more annoying than a serverless javascript project, so self-hosting entered the radar and well.... now I have a bunch of mini pcs on their way to start with :D

I spent like 4 days deep in research land and now all my youtube recommendations are homelab-related :D

## Current Homelab Plan
- Raspberry Pi 4 - control plane
- Dell OptiPlex 7070 - prod server
- HP EliteDesk 800 G5 - dev server
- HP EliteDesk 800 G4 - nas and media server

- Dev and Prod do not pull from NAS unless recovering from data loss
- Scheduled smartctl checks on all machines to alert me if a drive is about to go bad
- Uptime Kuma monitors backups and updates and sends a message when they do it successfully or unsuccessfully
