This guide explains what you **can**, **cannot**, and **must** do when using or forking a project licensed under the **Oxymoron Open Source License (OOSL) v1.0**.

---

## ✅ What You _Can_ Do
You are free to:
- 🔍 **Use the code** for personal projects, research, or education
- 🛠️ **Modify the code** and run it locally for your own purposes
- 🧪 **Experiment** with changes and share your learnings noncommercially
- 📤 **Distribute your modified version** so long as it remains free and open and you follow attribution and licensing requirements (see below)

## ❌ What You _Cannot_ Do
You are **not allowed** to:
- 💰 **Use the original project commercially** (e.g. in SaaS, products, client work, monetized services) **without written permission** from the original creator
- 💸 **Monetize your fork** unless it contains **significant original additions** and you have followed the attribution and relicensing rules
- 🧳 **Remove the original author’s name, branding, or credits**
- 🔒 **Make your fork closed-source** or distribute it under a proprietary license
- 🪞 **Claim your fork is the original project** or pretend you’re the creator

## 📋 What You _Must_ Do
If you fork or build upon an OOSL project and distribute it (publicly or privately), you must:
1. 📝 **Include the full OOSL license** in your repository or release
2. 🏷️ **Prominently credit the original creator** in your README, interface, or metadata (e.g. package.json, about screen)
3. 🧠 **Clearly describe what you changed**, ideally in a `CHANGES.md` or similar
4. 📎 **Retain all copyright, license, and attribution notices**
5. 📦 **Bundle this license** alongside any additional license you apply (if dual-licensed)
6. 🪪 **Only relicense your fork under a different open source license if it includes significant original additions**. Minor forks remain under OOSL.
7. 📎 **Retain the OOSL license on all portions of your fork that are derived from the original project**, even if the rest of your code is licensed differently.

## 💼 Want to Use an OOSL Project Commercially?
If you want to:
- Embed the project into a commercial product
- Use it internally at a business
- Build a commercial integration
- Use it in client-facing, revenue-generating work

You must **request written permission** from the original creator.
- 📬 Reach out using the contact information listed in the OOSL license file
- ✍️ Provide a brief explanation of your intended use and your organization
- 📄 The Licensor may offer a commercial license, revenue share, or dual license arrangement

No commercial use of the Software is permitted unless explicitly approved.

## 💡 Want to Monetize a Significant Fork?
If your fork adds **significant new features, functionality, or original content**, and you wish to monetize it:
- ✅ You may license your **original additions** however you like
- 🔒 **But:** any parts derived from the original OOSL project must remain under the OOSL and must be clearly indicated as such
- 📬 You may still wish to contact the original creator to clarify boundaries or negotiate permissions

---

## 🛡️ Why These Rules Exist
The OOSL is designed to:
- ✅ Encourage innovation and ethical open source contribution
- 🚫 Prevent corporations from exploiting free labor
- 💡 Allow devs to explore and remix, while protecting the original creator’s commercial rights

Thanks for respecting the license and supporting a healthier open source ecosystem ✨
