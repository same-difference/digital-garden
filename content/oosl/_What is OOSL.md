title: _What is OOSL?
---
I was looking at licenses for my upcoming [[Oxymoron Job Tracker]] bot and couldn't find anything that resonated. I love open source in theory. The collaboration, the iteration, the constant forks and push requests and a community coming together to build a product they believe in.

But the licenses... they were made by idealists in better times. By using something like the MIT license, you can get commercially exploited easily and while yeah you might get adoption, it comes at the cost of someone else having used your work for their profit without your consent.

So I looked at the github license list, but they all allowed for various flavors of exploitation due to being [OSI licenses](https://opensource.org/). I looked for alternatives but all I could find were things like [The Anti-Capitalist Software License](https://anticapitalist.software/), [The Purity License](https://paritylicense.com/), and more [fringe licenses](https://www.boringcactus.com/2021/09/29/anti-license-manifesto.html) from people more radical than I.

There didn't seem to be a middle ground beyond using a Creative Commons license with an addendum, which some have done with success, but those licenses weren't made for software and the organization themselves don't recommend using them for that.

So I took a stab at finding that middle ground. I wanted something that:
- protected my rights
- protected the rights of anyone who contributed
- protected the rights of anyone who made a derivative work without trapping them in an ecosystem
and most importantly of all: rejected nonconsensual commercial use while still leaving a path open to commercial collaboration with those with good intent.

Check out the [[Plain Language Guide]] or the [[Oxymoron Open Source License v1.0]] itself, both ready to drop straight into a repo.

You can also see how it compares to some [[OOSL vs Common Software Licenses|common software licenses]], how it compares to [[OOSL vs some other Source-Available Licenses|other source-available licenses]], and [[So You Want to Use an OOSL Project|what to know before using an OOSL-licensed project]].

## Why "'Oxymoron"?
My github name is [same-difference](https://github.com/same-difference) which is an oxymoron. I initially chose OOSL as a name because it was made for [[Oxymoron Job Tracker]], named that because of my github name. As I developed the license, I realized treading the line between open source and creator protection is quite tricky. You're trying to make two opposites play nice together; Truly an oxymoron.
