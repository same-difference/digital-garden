This document compares the **Oxymoron Open Source License (OOSL)** to five of the most common licenses developers often default to for their projects:

- **MIT License**
- **Apache 2.0 License**
- **GPL v3**
- **AGPL v3**
- **BSD 3-Clause License**

## Final Verdict

The OOSL stands alone in its ability to:
- Block corporate monetization without permission
- Still allow open source forks and ethical commercial paths
- Present superficial forks from being monetized
- Allow you to retain control while inviting collaboration

It‚Äôs ideal for solo developers and community projects that want to protect themselves *without closing the door* to contributors or innovation.
