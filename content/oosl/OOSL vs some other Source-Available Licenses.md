This document compares the **Oxymoron Open Source License (OOSL)** to five modern source-available licenses that attempt to control commercialization or ethical use of software.

- **Business Source License (BSL 1.1)**
- **Server Side Public License (SSPL)**
- **PolyForm Noncommercial**
- **Hippocratic License**
- **Fair Source License**

**Note:** SSPL and BSL are not recognized by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) as open source. They are considered **source-available** licenses because they impose additional restrictions that violate the Open Source Definition.

## Final Verdict

- **OOSL** offers more flexibility than PolyForm NC or BSL by allowing *fair, attributed commercial use* if it's significantly modified and approved.
- Unlike **SSPL**, **OOSL** doesn‚Äôt force re-licensing of entire SaaS infrastructure ‚Äî just enforces boundaries around unapproved monetization.
- Unlike **Hippocratic**, **OOSL** is not ethically subjective ‚Äî it's enforceable, permission-based, and specific in language.

OOSL is the ideal choice for developers who want to remain open to contribution and creativity ‚Äî while drawing a firm line around exploitation by for-profit actors.
