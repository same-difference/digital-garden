Contact: contact@[yourdomain].com or see https://yourdomain.com/oosl

## PREAMBLE

This license is designed to protect the original creator's rights while promoting free use, modification, and distribution of the software for non-commercial purposes. It allows for monetization of substantially modified derivative works while requiring explicit permission for commercial use of the Software. For commercial entities, the Licensor offers flexible dual-licensing options.

## 1. DEFINITIONS

a. "Software" means the original work in source code form, object code form, documentation, and any associated files, made available under this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means any work that is based on or derived from the Software through modification, enhancement, or extension, such that it contains significant original contributions beyond the Software.

c. "Significant" means the addition of substantial new functionality, features, or adaptations that fundamentally expand or change the purpose or application of the Software, not merely cosmetic changes, bug fixes, minor enhancements, user interface refactoring, or bundling the Software with other components.

d. "Commercial Use" means any of the following:
   i. Using the Software in or for a commercial, corporate, or business environment;
   ii. Using the Software to provide a service, product, or solution for which compensation is received, either directly or indirectly;
   iii. Using the Software to create a product or service that competes with the Software;
   iv. Incorporating the Software into a product or service that generates revenue, including through advertising;
   v. Using the Software for any activity where the user, or the user's employer or client, receives compensation related to that use;
   vi. Distribution of the Software as part of a commercial product or service, whether or not the Software itself is directly sold;
   vii. The operation of the Software to provide a publicly accessible service, including "Software as a Service" (SaaS) offerings, whether or not directly monetized.

"Commercial Use" does not include personal use, use for academic teaching or research, or use by nonprofit organizations for their internal nonprofit purposes, provided none of the above commercial activities apply.

e. "Contributor" means any individual or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of modifications to the Software.

f. "You" means any individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

g. "Licensor" means the copyright owner of the Software.

h. "Contribution" means any work of authorship, including modifications or additions to the Software, that is intentionally submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Software.

i. "Open Source License" means a license that meets the Open Source Definition (as published by the Open Source Initiative) or similar widely-recognized criteria for open source software.

## 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You:

a. A worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-commercial license to use, reproduce, modify, display, distribute, and run the Software in source or object code form.

b. The right to create, use, reproduce, modify, display, distribute, and run Derivative Works, provided that:
   i. You include significant new features, design, or functionality;
   ii. You clearly indicate what changes were made to the Software;
   iii. You include proper attribution as specified in Section 3;
   iv. You include a copy of this License.

c. The right to monetize Derivative Works that meet the criteria in Section 2(b), provided they are not represented, branded, or marketed as the Software, or as being created or maintained by the Licensor, unless explicitly approved.

d. In cases of dispute over whether a Derivative Work meets the "Significant" threshold, the Licensor will:
   i. Evaluate the work in good faith based on the criteria in Section 1(c);
   ii. Provide written reasoning for any determination;
   iii. Allow the developer of the Derivative Work 30 days to address any concerns or request clarification;
   iv. Offer commercial licensing options if the work does not meet the threshold.

e. Developers planning significant modifications with monetization intent are encouraged to contact the Licensor in advance for preliminary evaluation and guidance.

f. The right to distribute Derivative Works that meet the "Significant" threshold under a different Open Source License of Your choosing, provided that:
   i. The chosen license ensures the Derivative Work remains open source;
   ii. You comply with the attribution requirements in Section 3;
   iii. You include a copy of this License alongside Your chosen license;
   iv. You clearly indicate which portions of the work derive from the Software;
   v. The relicensing of Derivative Works under another Open Source License does not permit circumvention of Section 4. Any entity involved in monetization of such works must ensure Commercial Use of any portion derived from the Software complies with this License.

## 3. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

You must:

a. Include a copy of this License with all copies or substantial portions of the Software or Derivative Works;

b. Retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Software in any Derivative Works;

c. Include prominent attribution to the Licensor including:
   i. The name of the Licensor;
   ii. A link to the original source repository;
   iii. A statement indicating the Software is licensed under OOSL v1.0.

"Prominent" means attribution that is reasonably visible to users and must include at least one of the following:
   i. Clearly visible in the user interface if the Software has one;
   ii. Included in primary documentation;
   iii. Present in the README file or equivalent;
   iv. Displayed in any "About" or "Credits" section;
   v. Included in any package metadata.

For minimal projects without extensive interfaces or documentation, the attribution should be placed in the most appropriate location where users are likely to see it.

d. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software.

e. The Licensor reserves all rights to names, logos, and branding associated with the Software.

## 4. COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTIONS

a. Any Commercial Use of the Software requires explicit written permission from the Licensor.

   i. A detailed description of the intended Commercial Use;
   ii. The proposed compensation model or licensing terms;
   iii. Any other information requested by the Licensor.

   i. Grant permission with or without additional conditions;
   ii. Request compensation or revenue sharing;
   iii. Offer alternative or dual licensing options;
   iv. Deny the request.

d. Absent explicit permission, any Commercial Use of the Software or Derivative Works will be considered a breach of this License. Before initiating legal action for breach, the Licensor will provide written notice specifying the violation and allow 30 days to cure the breach.

e. Commercial entities interested in using the Software are encouraged to contact the Licensor regarding dual-licensing options that may provide more flexible terms for commercial applications.

   ii. Such patents cannot be used to prevent others from using, modifying, or distributing the Software;
   iii. Such patents cannot be used to claim ownership of the Software or any part thereof.

d. If You institute patent litigation against any entity regarding the Software or a Derivative Work, your rights under this License will automatically terminate.

## 7. TERMINATION

b. If Your rights have terminated, You may reinstate them by:
   i. Curing the violation;
   ii. Obtaining written permission from the Licensor.

## 8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any disputes arising under this License may be resolved through binding arbitration under mutually agreed rules and provider, if both parties consent. Otherwise, the dispute shall be resolved in the appropriate courts under Section 11.
