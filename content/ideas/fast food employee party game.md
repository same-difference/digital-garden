McDonald's simulator but also party horror game where whenever you go to the walk in to grab ingredients you encounter wacky creatures.

## Story
Your goal is: Your location is on the verge of getting shut down. So the region supervisor brought in an all new team made of all-star employees from every store in the region to give it one last go. Make it through the week and make $10,000 (scale it for difficulty levels) to save your store or you all lost your jobs and become homeless.
## Gameplay
### Money
Chance for the store to get robbed at gunpoint if you make a lot of money 3 days in a row.

You can call the security truck that takes the cash twice during the week to lock it in towards the $10k goal but then you have less money towards upgrades.
### Stock
At the end of the day you order stock for the next day and the truck arrives in the busiest part of the shift every fucking time.

The supply truck leaves if no one goes to unload it in time and you don't get a refund or your supplies from that order.
### Breaks
Every employee is required to have at least 1 meal break and 1 bathroom break, if you don't, you get debuffs and an infraction, and too many infractions gets you guys shut down too. You have a total of 5 infractions (tunable for difficulty) before you get shut down.

You cannot take a smoke break during a meal break
### Controls
Also one of those games where the controls are deliberately scuffed and you have a hard time moving items without hitting everything between point a and b, including other players, for comedic effect.
If you get bonked during a minigame the timer for your task gets longer, else it just stuns you for a sec.
### When Monsters Spawn
- Walk in freezer
- Cleaning bathrooms
- Taking out the trash
- Unloading the truck
- Washing dishes
- Basically anytime you're alone when working in a fast food restaurant
### Character Traits
You randomly spawn in with them.
- Nicotine addiction: you have to have smoke breaks or vape in the kitchen regularly or you get a speed debuff
- Glasses: your vision gets foggy if you're playing back of house for too long or if you go to the walk-in.
- Attractive: you generally have an easier time dealing with customers and get a chance to get tips if you play front of house but you're also more likely to get people hitting on you which makes the taking orders minigame harder and occasionally they wait for you outside the restaurant and kidnap you when you try to take out the trash or unload the truck.
- Manager, always spawns: has to calm down angry customers every once in a while, you also have a taser you can tase people with and can fire employees at any time
- Imposter, rare, stacks with other traits: they're a plant for your biggest rival. They want you to fail your goal so your rival restaurant has a monopoly of fast food burgers on that block. So everyone would lose, except for them.
- Single parent: your kid hangs around in the dining area all day on their phone and comes to the register to come ask you for things.
## Progression
### Individual Progression
Skill progression where the more you do the silly minigame associated with a task the more abilities you unlock in that minigame to get the job done better.
### Group Progression
There's also upgrades you can buy for your store
