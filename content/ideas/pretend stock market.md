What about a pretend stock market with a pretend job and a pretend economy and pretend gambling where you make an account and work your job which is clicking buttons that light up on the screen and clicking and typing on random words that appear on the screen as fast as you can or some other high-attention-needing quick repeatable task. Maybe inspired by incremental games, and from that money from your pretend job you can make your number go bigger and get your name higher on the leaderboard
