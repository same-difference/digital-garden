- ~: shortcut for the home of the current user. /home/username

## Git
### The ones I always forget about
* git fetch - pulls the latest commit history from the repo
* git branch -m master main - rename from master to main
### Setting up a new project
git init

git remote add origin git@github link

git push -u origin main

- -u is shorthand for --set-upstream
