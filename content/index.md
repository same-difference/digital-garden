[What's a digital garden?](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/)

I know, great SEO, me. Immediately linking off my own site as the very first thing on a homepage lol. But yeah I need to organize my thoughts more because sticky notes and a singular discord channel ain't doing it anymore.

Things are getting lost and forgotten, sometimes I put it in a different channel on accident. I'm tired of it. Let's fix that now, shall we?

This garden will be primarily focused on my various coding projects and ideas, as well as some coding resources and inspo. As you can tell, things are still pretty largely unorganized, but having it all in one place?

Progress!! ðŸ¥³
