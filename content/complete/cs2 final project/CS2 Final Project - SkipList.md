## Intro
[What is a SkipList?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list)
Okay, now make one in Java but all you can import has to be from [Java Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html) and it has to extend [SortedSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html). There were a few other requirements but that's the gist of it.

- [[Current Goals]] - current checklist
- [[Questions For Gerber]] - questions to ask later
- [[Task Breakdown]] - big comprehensive checklist
- [[Testcase Planning]] - functionality requirements
- [[SkipListTestingBonanza]] - testcase code
