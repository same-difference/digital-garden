My senior design project woohoo. I helped come up with the original idea, some font and color choices, but the bulk of my contributions were in the form of code: mainly the final database schema, a bunch of supabase functions, the user profile and customization system, and the big one: our custom smartwatch that displayed the user's schedule.

Insert some pics and more deets here, future-me, plz
#todo
