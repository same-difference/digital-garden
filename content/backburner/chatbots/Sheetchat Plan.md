## Old Plan
- [ ] download the raw csv files
- [ ] use google apps script and drive api to generate a 1-1 csv file that has the editor in each cell instead of the messages
- [ ] BIG STEP!!! Process the data with more tags like topics and emotions
- [ ] give the chatbot a memory of recent chat messages in the discord server with a database
- [ ] store past interactions and user specific details in another database as well
- [ ] create a discord bot to be able to talk to the chatbot
- [ ] deploy to aws and hope and pray

## New Plan
- [ ] llms have probably advanced since [[Fall 2024]], so look up new models I can train (DeepSeek??), especially locally since the data is super personal
- [ ] .... discord has a data export function with every message you've ever sent..... [[mechatbot]]???
