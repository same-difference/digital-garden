## Why?
I'm a very visual planner and my default is sticky notes, but when I have multiple projects at once there's around 20 sticky notes on my desk and my cat knocks them all over the place. All the visual planning tools I've used so far are either paid or incredibly fiddly and annoying to use, hence: storyboarder!
## The Gist
A browser-based visual story planning tool focused around lots of text that uses draggable cards on a canvas where you can go as fast as [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) and click type click type, but with more features and a prettier ui like [Milanote](https://milanote.com/)
### Canvas Interface
- Clickable and draggable cards on a canvas.
- Create connections between cards by dragging.
- Highlight multiple cards and move them as a group.
- Shift-click to select multiple cards.
- Click anywhere on the canvas to start typing.
- Right-click to create a new card from a saved template.
- Save the locations of cards.
- Multiple canvas view variants, saving locations and connections with the same cards.
- Color picker, line styles, and settings at the bottom of the screen for bulk card creation.
- Pan and zoom in/out on the canvas.
- Drag from the edge of a card to add a new connection.
- When a card is selected, bottom bar settings affect that selection rather than the next card created.
- Bookmark cards and create a collapsible table of contents on the side to jump around the canvas.
- Zoom-in, zoom-out, and view-all buttons for easy navigation.
- Recycle bin in the corner to delete cards by dragging them there or right-clicking.
### Connection Customization
- Choose the color, type (solid, dotted, dashed), and arrow styles (both ends, one end, no arrow) of connections.
### Card Customization
- Choose card color and add borders.
- Auto-resized cards to fit all content.
- Smart snap points per side of each card.
- Line rerouting around cards to avoid overlap and take the shortest path.
- Change font size of cards.
### Data Management
- Temporary server storage for session data; data saved when the user logs in.
- User accounts and sessions tied to saved data.
### Exporting and Multi-user Support
- Export the canvas as an image or PDF.
- Customize the background color of the exported image.
- Link canvases for collaborative editing and invite others to view or edit.
- Cards actively edited by other users are highlighted in that userâ€™s color.
### Database Cards
- Single-field cards are non-database entries; multiple fields become - database cards.
- Click to view a pop-up with all card info.
- Rearrange fields within database cards.
- Changes to database cards auto-update.
- Pin fields to make them viewable in the small card format.
- Link cards by dragging them onto each other or by @mentioning in fields.
- Linked cards appear as tabs within a main card on the canvas.
### Templates
- Template layouts with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Save custom templates and apply them to cards or canvases.
- Template layouts include cards, positions, connections, preset headings, pinned fields, and saved templates.
### AI Integration
- Right-click on multiple cards to generate a compiled document.
- Ask AI for ideas based on selected cards (e.g., plot beats, characters, settings).
- AI provides ideas in pop-up dialogue bubbles for easy selection.
- Right-click to fill in empty fields with AI suggestions.
- AI icon in the top bar for canvas-wide operations.
